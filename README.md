## ArenaApp2018

PLEASE USE THE LATEST VERSIONS OF ALL LIBRARIES AND ANDROID STUDIO

### Overall priorities / instructions

* ASK IF IN DOUBT
* App needs to be finished on time. Current target for a testable app: 7th Jan 2018. Final Release Target: 14th Jan 2018
* A minimal UI is fine; adhere to Material Design when in doubt.
* Write good commit messages. [this blog post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) is a good reference. You'll easily find others.


### Major Libraries to be used

* [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) for web requests
* The old `Sponsors` code uses [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) for loading, but I don't mind a shift to others like [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/)
* I would prefer [REALM](https://realm.io/docs/java/latest/#getting-started) as a database over `SQLite`. The latter is not an issue if you guys feel REALM will take too long to learn and delay the app.
